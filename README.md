# Pidgin Chatlog Aggregator
Pidgin Chatlog Aggregator is a small tool written in Java SE to aggregate HTML ICQ logs from Pidgin [https://www.pidgin.im/] to a CSV file
## Features
The tool is currently only able to parse ICQ logs from the folder structure generated by Pidgin (e.g. `.purple\logs\icq\343641434`).
## Requirements
Any Java IDE which supports Gradle with a Java version of at least 21. If you know what you're doing and know Java, you can compile and run it as you please.
## Executing
The tool has an entrypoint in `de.maio290.pidgin.PidginChatlogAggregator` which can be used to run it via console. However, this is very limited and does no error checking at all. 
## Future
Probably none, this is something I wrote in about one hour to prepare these messages for use with a LLM for a very specific personal reason.
